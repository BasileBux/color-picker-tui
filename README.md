# TUI color picker

A simple TUI color picker built in Rust. 

I needed to learn some Rust basics fast so I remade [this](https://github.com/BasileBux/color-picker-tui)
project I once wrote in Zig. It looks the same but is now written in Rust so it's
blazingly fast™. And the codebase is way cleaner. Also, this time I read about color
representations so the saturation and value picker is actually correct.

## TODO

- [ ] Add clipboard copy/paste support
